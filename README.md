**Patient Safety March Madness Competition for Nursing**

The "Nursing Patient Safety March Madness" project is an interactive competition designed to engage nursing staff in a fun and collaborative way, drawing inspiration from the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament. The initiative aims to foster team spirit, healthy competition, and camaraderie among the nursing teams.​

**Implementation Overview**:

Google Sheets: A central Google Sheet is created to manage and track the competition's data, including team standings, scores, and schedules. This sheet serves as the backbone for data storage and is integrated with other Google Workspace tools.​

Google App Scripts: Custom scripts are developed using Google Apps Script to automate various tasks, such as updating scores, sending notifications, and generating reports. These scripts enhance efficiency and ensure real-time data synchronization across platforms.

Google Forms: Forms are utilized to facilitate daily competitions and gather participant responses. For example, the "Daily Competition" form allows team members to submit their answers or predictions, which are then automatically recorded in the Google Sheet for scoring.​

Google Sites Integration: A dedicated Google Site serves as the central hub for the competition, providing participants with easy access to schedules, team information, daily challenges, and leaderboards. This site ensures transparency and keeps all participants informed and engaged.​

**Website Structure and Purpose:**

Home Page: Introduces the competition, outlines the rules, and provides an overview of the event's objectives.​

Daily Competition: Hosts daily challenges or questions that teams need to answer. Participants can access the Google Form for each day's competition through this section.​

Teams: Displays information about each participating team, including team names, members, and unique icons or logos that represent their identity.​

**Google Forms Explanation:**

The "Daily Competition" section features Google Forms designed to collect responses from participants on various challenges or questions posed daily. These forms are structured to capture essential information such as the participant's name, team affiliation, and their answers to the day's questions. The responses are automatically linked to the central Google Sheet, where scores are calculated, and standings are updated accordingly.​

**Teams and Icons:**

Each team participating in the competition has a dedicated section showcasing their unique identity. This includes team names, a list of members, and custom icons or logos that represent their spirit and creativity. These icons are stored in the "icons" folder within the project's GitHub repository.

By integrating various Google Workspace tools and custom scripts, the "Nursing Patient Safety March Madness" project creates an engaging and seamless experience for all participants, promoting teamwork and a sense of community within the nursing staff.
